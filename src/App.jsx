/*================================================================
 React Data Fetching
   
  Optional Hints:
     - Use this https://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search?query=React 
     API endpoint of the Hacker News API

     - Remove the initialStories variable, because this data will 
     come from the API.

     - remove getAsyncStories because will fetch the data directly from the API.
     - Use the browser's native fetch API to perform the request.

     - Note: A successful or erroneous request uses the same 
     implementation logic that we already have in place.

  Review what is useState?
      - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usestate-hook/

      - When a state gets mutated, the component with the state 
      and all child components will re-render.

      - Use the browser's native fetch API to perform the request.

      - Note: A successful or erroneous request uses the same 
      implementation logic that we already have in place.
      
  Review what is useEffect?
    - https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-useeffect-hook/
    
    - What does useEffect do? by using this hook you tell React that 
     your component needs to do something after render.

const getAsyncStories = () =>

      () => resolve({ data: { stories: initialStories } }),

//reducerHook is best to use if multiple states are dependent on each other.
//For stories, boolean is Loading, and error are all related to data fetching. 
//All three properties/state could be a part of one complex object (example data, isLoading, error)
//managed by a reducer

//Again the first thing to do when using React.useReducer hook
//is to define a reducer function outside of the component.
//A reducer function always receives a state and an action. 
//Based on these two arguments, returns a new state.

/* 
 We changed two things from the above original reducer function. 
   1. First, we introduced new types when we called the dispatch 
      function from the outside. 
      Therefore we need to add the following new cases for state transitions.
         'STORIES_FETCH_INIT' 
         'STORIES_FETCH_SUCCESS'
         'STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE'
         'REMOVE_STORY'
         throw new Error();
   2. Second, we changed the state structure from an array to 
      a complex object. Therefore we need to take the new complex 
      object into account as incoming state and returned state:

   3.For every state transition, we return a new state object 
     which contains all the key/value pairs from the current 
     state object (via JavaScript's spread operator ...state) and 
     the new overwriting properties 
     
     For example, STORIES_FETCH_FAILURE sets the 
     isLoading boolean to false and sets the isError boolean 
     to true, while keeping all the the other state intact 
     (e.g. data alias stories)

 /*Note on Map:
   Within the map() method, we have access to each object and its properties.

    console.log(fullName);


 //useState
    By using useState, we are telling React that we want to have a 
 stateful value which changes over time. And whenever this stateful value 
 changes, the affected components (here: Search component) 
 will re-render to use it (here: to display the recent value).

  //Work flow of a useState:
       When the user types into the input field, the input field's change event 
      runs into the event handler. The handler's logic uses the event's value 
      of the target and the state updater function to set the updated state. 
      Afterward, the component re-renders (read: the component function runs). 
      The updated state becomes the current state (here: searchTerm) and is 
      displayed in the component's JSX.

  //Arrow Function
    function getTitle(title) { - convert to arrow function see below
    
    const getTitle =(title) => 
       (
        title
       );

    Eliminate bracket and "return" statement if no business logic before 
    the function - concise
   

  //Arrow function - 
   If there is a business business logic. Otherwise retain the {} and
   put a "return" statement 
     const App = () => {
       ...
       return xyz;
     } 
 
  //How to use a React.Reducer hook 
  To use Reducer (1) first define a reducer function.
     1. A reducer action is always associated with a type. As best 
        practice with a payload.
        Example:
          const storiesReducer = (state, action) =>{
          if (action.type === 'SET_STORIES'){
            //If the type matches a condition in the reducer. Return a new
            //state based on the incoming state and action
            return action.payload;
          }
          else{
          //throw an error if isn't covered by the reducer to remind yourself
          //that the implementation is not covered
            throw new Error();
          }
        }
      2. The second thing to do is to replaceReact.useState to use a reducer hook
         like this: 

          const [stories, dispatchStories] = React.useReducer(storiesReducer,[]);

          1. receives a reducer function called "storiesReducer"
          2. receives an initial state of empty array []
          3. returns an array with 2 item: 
            - The first item is "stories" which is the current state
            - The second item is the updater function named "dispatchStories"
            Unlike useState, the updater function of Reducer sets the state
            "implicitly" by dispatching an "action". Example:
               dispatchStories({
                 type: 'SET_STORIES',   <== this is the action
               payload: result.data.stories,
             });
       
 */
